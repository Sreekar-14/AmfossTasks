The bot which i have created may help to execute commands in a telegram chat, which then directly accepts the action or the incomming instructions.
This can help for the readers like gopal to find the book as per his intrests and etc.
there were evn many features like /start: , /book: , /preview: , /list: and many more which can help to intreact with the users.
I had faced a few problems in doing this but i tried to do it.
